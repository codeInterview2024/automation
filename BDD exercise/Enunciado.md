## Tasks
We would like you to define a testing Scenario to validate something you would consider when entering to some web site. For example:
    - Do some search in mercadolibre.com and validate the products you receive match with what you are looking for
    - At bestbuy.com add some product and validate it is added to the cart 

The expected deliveries for this exercise are:
1. Feature file in Gherkin syntax that describes the testing scenario
2. Step definitions implemented in Python for each step in your feature file
3. Live demo!
